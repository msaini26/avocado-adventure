## Modification Idea

- Name: Mansi Saini
- Title: Candy Clouds
- Time: 30+ hours approximately

## 5-Point Tier

âœ… Track a high score that persists across scenes and display it in the UI (5)
    
    - high score is on the top right of the screen

âœ… Implement the 'FIRE' UI text from the original game (5)
    
    - 'FIRE' UI text is in between score and high score when the player is firing

âœ… Add your own (copyright-free) background music to the Play scene (please be mindful of the volume) (5)
     
     - background music was in the play screen

âœ… Implement the speed increase that happens after 30 seconds in the original game (5)
     
     - after 30 seconds, the game speeds up

âœ… Create a new scrolling tile sprite for the background (5)
   
    - implemented sunset background


## 10-Point Tier
âœ… Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen (10)
    
    - time remaining is visible on bottom left of play screen

âœ… Create a new title screen (e.g., new artwork, typography, layout) (10)
    
    - candy clouds home page and controls page to teach player controls
        (bonus: added controls and rules pages of game)__

âœ… Implement parallax scrolling for the background (10)
    
    - fog moves at a different speed than the clouds and the ground

## 15-Point Tier
âœ… Create a new enemy Spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points (15)
    
    - gummy bear is flying so fast on the left

âœ… Implement a new timing/scoring mechanism that adds time to the clock for successful hits (15)
    
    - adds 5ish seconds for each successful hit
        **(bonus: added an enemy egg that decreases the time left if you hit it - 20 seconds)**

âœ… Implement mouse control for player movement and mouse click to fire (15)
     
     - choose mouse control in the controls menu before continuing into the game
